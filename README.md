# Microbit-Accelerator_Data-Analysis

This project includes Accelerometer Data Analysis, Radio Communication Programming, Angular Measurement Calculation. 
https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/makecode-wireless-data-logger/ is used for radio commmunication.

Requirements:
* 2x micro:bit 
* 1x Battery 
* 1x USB-C Cable
* Access to a computer with internet

The project uses one of the micro:bit as a accelerometer sensor and the other one as a signal receiver and writer. After collecting the data, use 2-)Accelerometer_Data-Analysis/Accelerometer_Analysis.ipynb to go through the Data Analysis provided by us.

How to use: 
* After doing the configurations for the micro:bits, shake and accelerate the sensor micro:bit to send acceleration data.
* Then, when you finish experimenting(Suggested for approx. 1min), download the raw text.
* Download the 2-)Accelerometer_Data-Analysis/Accelerometer_Analysis.ipynb file and open it in Google Colab( https://colab.research.google.com )
* Follow the steps on the notebook.
